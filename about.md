About me
========

I'm a professional software developer with 2 wonderful kids, a [fluffy
dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi), and [amazing
wife](http://www.prettycitythings.com).

In my spare time I like to bike, play board games and video games, watch movies,
listen to music, cook, and a bunch of other stuff.

I wrote more about growing up [here]({% post_url 2013-06-16-growing-up %}).
