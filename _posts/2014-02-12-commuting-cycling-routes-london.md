title: "A couple of London commuting routes by bike"
---

I moved to the UK a few months ago. One of the first things I did was
pick up a Brompton for my multimodal commute. I ride to the station in
the morning, take the train, then go from the station to my office by
bike. I save quite a bit on travel card costs (which let's one use a
railcard for the London underground), so my bike will pay for itself
before too long.

Finding the right route for me took some trial and error, and I'm
still improving it. Here's what I have so far.

Marylebone to Fitzrovia
=======================

I arrive in Marylebone station:

1. Exit station and go left (east) across ped walk, then first right on
  Balcombe all the way to Marylebone road.
2. Cross road with pedestrians
3. Continue on Balcombe, take second left onto Crawford (going east
  again).
4. Continue on Crawford past Baker, take a right onto the narrow
  road that runs along the park on the right. Easy to miss, but
  immediately recognizable.
5. Follow road around bend until you hit Marylebone High Street, continue
  onto Weymouth - you have to cross over the high street diagonally.
6. Weymouth all the way to the end when it hits Great Portland, make
  a right, then first left onto Clipstone.
7. Follow Clipstone/Maple and get off where you need to. I make a right
  at Charlotte and follow it until I reach my office.

Getting back to Marylebone is a bit simpler:

1. Head west on Howland/New Cavendish all the way to Marylebone
  High Street. Simple!
2. Take a right onto the high street, go up a few blocks and make a
  left onto Paddington.
3. Follow Paddington through 2 major intersections (Baker, Gloucester)
  before making a right onto Upper Montague.
4. Upper Montague becomes Balcombe, the same way we came from the
   station.

Both ways are quite pleasant routes for daily commuting.

Waterloo to Fitzrovia
=====================

I took this route when I first moved and was staying with
relatives. It's nowhere as pleasant as the Marylebone route, it's much
busier and crazier. But you have to make do :-).

From Waterloo station:

1. Exit out of the north side and follow the ramp down past the Boris
  bikes to York Road.
2. Go right on York to the roundabout/traffic light, then go left onto
  Waterloo bridge.
3. At the end of the bridge you hit the infamous Lancaster/Strand
  intersection (infamous due to the nonsense car/bike/bus/pedestrian
  traffic flow).
4. At this point you follow most of the cyclists as they cross the
  intersection and go over the pedestrian sidewalk onto Wellington.
  Recognizable because there is an oft-ignored cyclist/ped traffic
  light on the sidewalk.
5. Take the second right onto Tavistock to get to Drury Lane.
6. Go left on Drury Lane (going north again) and follow it all the way
  as it becomes Museum and you reach the British Museum on Great
  Russell.
7. The idea now is to go around the museum to its back. So right on
   Great Russell, then first left onto Montague, then first left
   onto Montague Pl.
8. You have a few options depending on where you want to end up. For
   me, I take the first right onto Malet, left onto Torrington
   all the way to the end. Then right onto Tottemham Court Road.
9. Finally I go left onto Howland (note you can connect here to my
   previous route to get to Marylebone), then left onto Charlotte and
   my office.

And back to Waterloo:

1. Get to Maple and head east, then go right onto Huntley (right
   before Gower). Optionally you can just go onto Gower, although I
   try to avoid the busy roads w/ buses as much as possible.
2. Follow Huntley all the way to the end, then take a left onto
   Chenies, then first right onto Gower.
3. Follow Gower all the way to the end (it becomes Shaftesbury at some
   point). Cross over the intersection at St. Giles High Street, bearing
   right onto Endell.
4. Follow Endell all the way as it becomes Bow Street and then
   Wellington - and we end up at Strand/Lancaster again.
5. Cross over the ped sidewalk and then the intersection to Waterloo
   Bridge again (following the signals, of course...). Careful that
   buses have a special priviledge to make an 'illegal' right turn
   onto the bridge, and it seems to happen when cyclists are crossing.
6. Continue over the bridge. Slow down and signal left as the bridge
   starts ramping down, and take the first left before the
   roundabout. You immediately go left again and start going down a
   road towards the river.
7. At the bottom, go left under the bridge and follow the water line
   on Belvedere. You take the second left and go through a pedestrian
   tunnel back to the crossing at York road. A little hard to describe
   but easy once you do it.
8. Cross York and you're at Waterloo.

I never liked coming down Gower when I took this route, but I couldn't
figure out a nicer way to go. The other dodgy bit is the
Strand/Lancaster crossing but it's unavoidable.

Some more tips
==============

* You can fit a Brompton between two chair backs on most train lines. It looks like a triangle /\ and you can stick the folded up brompton in there.
