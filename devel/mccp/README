by James Ravn - james dot ravn at gmail dot com

CHANGES:
2.0
* Re-coded negotiation to be more robust. Fixes some "Vusername" bugs.
* Use CREATE macros instead of callocs (thanks to fnord from the CWG team). 
* Better commenting and minor code reformatting.
* Fixed blatant memory leak when freeing compression structure (thanks to fnord again).

1.0
* Initial version

OVERVIEW:
This patch adds MCCP2 support.  See http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/mcp.htm for
information on the protocol.  Most mud clients support MCCP2 these days, and
it's a great way to cut down on bandwidth usage.  With some testing, I was
able to get an average of around 80% bandwidth reduction.

This patch is designed to be light weight and transparent. It enables MCCP
automatically for clients that request it.

INSTALL:
This patch has been tested to apply cleanly to Circle 3.1.

1) Move patch into the src directory, after you run configure
2) patch < mccp2_2.0.patch
3) Add -lz to the LIBS parameter, around line 25 of the Makefile. This is for
   linking to zlib.
4) Run make

Zlib must be installed.

TODO:
* Add zlib dependencies in configure script and sysdep.h
