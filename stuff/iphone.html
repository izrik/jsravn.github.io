    <title>iPhone 1 year review</title>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
I've been using an iPhone 3G for a year now and have reached a steady state
usage pattern. So, I think it's an ideal time to give a review of the phone.
<p>
When I got an iPhone 3G a year ago, it was easily the best phone on the
market. I had worked at a large cell phone company and seen many different UIs. The
iPhone UI blew them all away due to its simplicity and speed.
<p>
My initial excitement has now worn off, and I've been putting up with quite a
few annoying quirks. It was revolutionary at its release and is still better
than any non-smartphone. But I would probably consider one of the Android phones
if I was looking - perhaps when my contract runs out in another year.
<p>
Now it's quite easy to find out all the great things about the iPhone. So
instead, I'll focus on the negatives. What are the bad things I have to put up
with?

<h2>Touch screen keyboard</h2>
<p>
I'll start with the obvious - the touch screen keyboard. I went through a
love/hate relationship with the keyboard at first. I disliked it initially,
then I started learning to use it to the point where I thought nothing of
it. But now I find myself avoiding the keyboard at all costs. I will use it
occasionally, but it's extremely frustrating to use for anything of decent
length. This is not a fault of the phone size either - at one point in my
career I used a blackberry and I could bust out full emails in no time flat.
The touch screen is an inferior method of entering data. And unfortunately, I
find myself now waiting until I get to a computer before writing my emails or
reddit comments.
<p>
Why exactly does the iPhone's touchscreen keyboard suck? It's hard to put into
words, but I will try. First problem is lack of tactile response. This means a
lot more visual confirmation is required when typing. Along with this, the
lack of throw (squishiness when pushing a button) puts quite a lot of strain
on my fingers. There is no cushion when I push, so I'm basically pushing a
hard screen in a rapid, repetitive manner. The third reason, which I'll get
into more detail later, is the iPhone 3.0+ UI is extremely sluggish. I will
press a key and it takes several seconds to respond.
<p>
As an additional snafu with the keyboard input, the word completion is
*awful*. I find it attempts to mis-correct far more than it corrects. So I've
disabled it. I'm not sure the reason for the false positives - I get the feeling the
dictionary is just not very good or suited for mobiles.

<h2>Sluggishness</h2>
<p>
I never had a problem with sluggishness when I first got my phone. At least, I
don't remember having any. I'm not sure when it started happening, but I think
around the 3.0 release is when it started getting very bad. The general
symptom is slow response to user input. The screen will take up to a minute to
refresh in some instances. This is when I will reboot my iPhone, which helps
until it starts happening again a few days again later.
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the most obvious transgression is in the keyboard. I
push a key, it blows up, but takes a while before it actually registers. There
is no key buffer on an iPhone so I have to wait before I can do my next
input. It is extremely frustrating.
<p>
The most obvious application with problems is Google Maps. In many cases it is
completely unusable for me. The maps freezes when I load it up and I usually
have to wait a minute before I can do anything at all. And of course, it seems
to happen when I need the maps the most. :-)
<p>
My theory is that Apple stopped testing the performance of the iPhone 3G and
iPhone after the iPhone 3GS came out. Since the 3GS has more memory and CPU it
probably covers performance issues that will occur on older phones. Still, it
sucks that performance seems to have regressed with new OS updates. I wish I
had stuck with 2.0 software!
<p>
The sluggishness is likely due to memory fragmentation. It is really hard to
take care of fragmented memory in an embedded system with a small memory
footprint. It requires being very careful with memory allocs in the phone
software. And I'm sure using objective C does *not* help here due to lack of
GC and inclination to create objects on the heap. This is why a phone reboot
helps - it resets the memory, essentially defragging it.

<h2>Youtube has never worked, until recently</h2>
<p>
For the first 10 or so months, Youtube never worked for me. It would either
load indefinitely and never play, or I would get a message saying the video is
not supported on an iPhone.
<p>
This seems to have changed over the last couple of months. I've had relatively
few problems with Youtube links recently. But it was a bit of a sore point
during my iPhone honeymoon period.

<h2>Safari browser is slow</h2>
<p>
The safari browser is amazingly functional compared to any other built in
browser I've tried. However, it suffers from some sort of performance problem and
effectively throttles my connection. This is easily provable by tethering the
iPhone to a laptop (a simple feat when 3.0 was first released). The laptop's
browser speed is noticeably faster compared to the phone's browser.
<p>
I have no idea if this is fixed on the 3GS. But on the 3G, the 3G network
speed is unfortunately throttled by Safari. Too bad we can't load Opera mini
on the phone.

<h2>AT&amp;T is the worst wireless network in existence</h2>
<p>
My previous phone was on T-Mobile, where I had no problems with dropped
calls. In the last 12 months, I get dropped calls frequently. I'm glad I
haven't had to do a job phone screen in that time. The network reliability blows.
<p>
Likewise, the data network is quite poor. Note, as mentioned earlier, this is
partly due to the iPhone's browser which seems to throttle download speed. But
in addition, the network, particularly in downtown Chicago, is horribly
congested. It's very difficult to browse anything at a decent speed. Pages
just hang and the little loading circle goes indefinitely. In addition, my 3G
icon will disappear seemingly at random, and cycle through the (E)dge symbol
and the no-data circle symbol. It just plain sucks. To be fair though, it's
significantly better out in the suburbs.
<p>
My last gripe would be the lack of tethering. I pay a small fortune for
wireless data connectivity, what does it matter which device I use?

<h2>GPS is so-so</h2>
<p>
Don't plan to replace your car GPS with the iPhone GPS. It's easy to lose
signal, as I discovered during a recent cross country trip to Kentucky where
my phone GPS was basically useless (I was trying a turn by turn iPhone
app). This is also probably why AT&amp;T's navigation application gets such
poor reviews.  Any significant cloud cover or building cover can cause
problems. Although admittedly, I don't have too many problems in the Chicago
suburbs just using Google maps.
