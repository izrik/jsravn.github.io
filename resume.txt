  Experience

Senior Software Engineer, Motorola Mobile Devices (Libertyville, IL)
Jan. 2006 - Current

* Rated in the top 10% of the company in my annual performance review. 
  Received a fast promotion to Senior Software Engineer after 10 months with 
  the company, a position typically reserved for someone with 2-3 years of 
  experience.

* Created a web tool to automate the approval process for terminating and 
  duplicating software defects. Worked closely with my customers and used an 
  iterative style of development, releasing changes early and often. (Ruby on 
  Rails)

* Created a defect tracking tool to work with a legacy database missing key 
  metrics. Created a RESTful web front end, allowing data to be accessed in 
  many formats in a standard way. (ASP, Ruby on Rails)

* Adapted a single file ASP tool into a web suite of data mining tools 
  organized by the Model-View-Controller design pattern. These tools use 
  sophisticated SQL queries for legacy databases and produce Excel files with 
  charts and data. (ASP)

* Created an automated web based system for managing defect backlog plans. It 
  is used successfully on our Linux/Java and 3G cell phones. (ASP)

* Co-designed and implemented several Excel tools for software defect and ship 
  date estimation that have been used successfully on our Linux/Java and 3G 
  cell phones. Learned many statistical techniques in a short time frame, 
  including regression analysis, queuing theory and Markov chains. (Excel, 
  Minitab)

* Co-led user trial improvement project, including documentation, training, 
  and community support.

* Deployed and modified BugzillaMetrics open source metrics tool, adding 
  features such as servlet container authentication support. Several patches 
  were accepted by the upstream maintainer. (Java, J2EE, Google Web Toolkit) 

* Data mining and analysis of various data sources to support data driven 
  decisions by product managers. Created scripts for use by team members to 
  automate data mining tasks. (Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL, ldap, ClearDDTS, HTML 
  scraping)

Software Engineer, Signal Transport (Irvine, CA)
Sept. 2005 - Jan. 2006

* Designed and implemented a public website for a new product line. (Ruby on 
  Rails)

Extra-curricular

* Added support for the Linux kernel RTC in an open source Quakeworld client. 
  (C)

* Co-creator of the Autocomplete Manager, a Firefox addon with 100,000+ 
  downloads. (Javascript, XUL)

* Implemented zlib compression of a telnet stream for an open source MUD, 
  following the MCCP protocol. (C)

* Implemented database support using the MySQL C library, replacing the legacy 
  flat file system for an open source MUD. (C)

* Created a simple RISC CPU on a Xilinx FPGA and developed several assembly 
  programs for it, such as quick sort. (Assembly)

* Created a compiler for a mini Java language using JavaCC, involving language 
  translation steps and grammars. (Java)

* Implemented a Blackjack AI program using temporal difference backpropagation 
  learning on a neural net. (Ruby)

* Created an open source monte carlo/discrete event simulation library. (C, 
  Java)
