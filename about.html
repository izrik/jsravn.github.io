<h1>Travelling across the United States</h1>
<p>
I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the first born of Jorgen and Shane
Ravn. My dad was born in Denmark and my mom was born in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia at
the time). They both immigrated to South Africa where fortunately they met, got
married, and had me.
</p>
<p>
My brother Nick was born a year and a half later in South Africa. My family
immigrated to the United States shortly after, when I was about 3. It was a big
journey for them, being financially and emotionally tough. South Africa was
starting to destabilize at the time and my parents rightly felt the states
would be safer and provide more opportunities.
</p>
<p>
My family immigrated to Nashville, Tennessee. I spent a good deal of my
childhood there but never managed to pick up the accent. We all had really
strong South African accents. I clearly remember my 2nd grade teacher showing
the BBC version of &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&quot; and
pointing out, incorrectly, that they had an accent &quot;just like
James!&quot;</p>
<p>
It didn't take long to lose my accent. My dad's job required a lot of travel,
and I ended up living a lot of different places. I moved to Foster City,
California when I was about 10, and then to Long Island, New York when I was
12. Right before high school we moved back to Foster City, where I went to San
Mateo High School for 4 years. After that, mostly due to the insane house
prices, my family moved to Lake Forest, California (about an hour south of LA).
</p>
<p>
I made a lot of friends while travelling around, and I'm amazed I've kept in
contact with them. If it wasn't for the internet I would have long lost touch
with a lot of the people from my childhood. I'm not much of a letter
writer. Isn't technology great?
</p>

<h1>Beginnings</h1>
<p>
When I was about 10, my family bought a shiny new IBM i386 PC (my mom worked
for IBM at the time). I thought it was the coolest thing ever. We had a big
ol' 5.25&quot floppy disk filled with games. I fondly remember playing VGA
trek with my younger brother Nick, commanding him to fire photon torpedos and
charging into black holes.
</p>
<p>
At some point I discovered this great thing called GW-BASIC and it was downhill
from there. QBasic was my next stepping point, which I used to create a few
mouse driven graphical games in DOS. One of my favorite creations was called
UFP - &quot;Unidentified Flying Pizzas&quot;. You had to click on pizzas and
other objects as they scrolled across the screen to shoot them. I wish I still
had the source code, that game was awesome.
</p>
<p>
In high school I started diving into C and C++. I also had a TI-82 calculator,
and TI games were all the rage at the time. I created a game or two that got
pretty popular around my highschool. One was called &quot;TIE Fighter&quot; I
think - based on a similar MS-DOS game I had played. You had a target that you
moved around the screen, and you would shoot lasers as TIE fighters flew around
blasting your base. In retrospect I probably should have been studying harder
rather than making games for TI calculators. :-)
</p>
<p>
At this point I had a really good idea what I wanted to do. I loved
programming, so I decided to seek a degree in C.S. I ended up going to UCLA,
where I graduated in 2005 with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I
spent a good deal of my time at university programming in C on Circle MUDs. At
the same time I somehow managed to meet my amazing wife and fool her into
marrying me.
</p>

<h1>Illinois</h1>
<p>
When I graduated, I ended up getting a position at Motorola right as the RAZR
was coming out. I moved with my wife in 2005 to Lake County in Illinois, about
10 minutes away from Motorola HQ in Libertyville. It was tough for both of us
not having any connections in a new place, but we felt it was worth it. This
was my first job and the company was doing very well. I was also enticed by a
generous reimbursement policy that could pay for further education.
</p>
<p>
I stayed at Motorola for three years. I was fortunate enough to work with a
dedicated, smart team where I learned a lot. With a baby on the way and waves
of layoffs hitting Libertyville, I decided it was time to leave.

<h1>Meeting Lizzie</h1>
<p>
When I was writing this page I showed Lizzie a draft and she told me
sarcastically &quot;I see how much you wrote about your wife&quot;. I was just
saving the best for last, duh. :-)
</p>
<p>
One of the greatest experiences of my life has been meeting my wife, falling in
love, and getting married. It's as cheesy as it sounds. Really, I'm just a
lucky son of a submariner. Marriage is great, I highly recommend it.
