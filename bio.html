<h2>Travelling across the world</h2>
<p>
I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the first born of Jorgen and Shane Ravn. My dad was born in Denmark and my mom was born in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia at the time). They both immigrated to South Africa where, quite fortunately, they met, got married, and had me.
</p>
<p>
My brother Nick was born a year and a half later in South Africa. Shortly after, when I was about 3, my family immigrated to the United States. It was a big journey for them and tough both financially and emotionally. South Africa was starting to destabilize at the time and my parents rightly felt that we'd be much safer and have much better opportunities in the states.
</p>
<p>
My parents immigrated to Nashville, Tennessee. I spent a good deal of my childhood there but never managed to pick up the accent. My family, including me, had really strong South African accents. I remember one time when I was in 2nd grade, and my teacher was showing the BBC version of "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe". She pointed out that all the kids on there had an accent "just like James!"</p>
<p>
It didn't take long to lose my accent. My dad's job required a lot of travel, and we ended up living a lot of different places. We moved to Foster City, California when I was about 10, and then to Long Island, New York when I was 12. Right before high school we moved back to Foster City, where I went to San Mateo High School for 4 years. After that, mostly due to the insane house prices, my family moved to Lake Forest, California about an hour south of Los Angeles.
</p>
I made a lot of friends while travelling around, and I'm amazed that I've kept in contact with them. If it wasn't for the internet I would have long lost touch with a lot of the people from my childhood (I'm not much of a letter writer). Ain't technology great?

<h2>My life as a programmer</h2>
<p>
I suppose it's always easiest to start at the beginning. When I was about 10, my family bought a shiny new IBM i386 PC (my mom worked at IBM at the time). I thought it was the coolest thing ever. We had a big ol' 5.25&quot floppy disk filled with games. I fondly remember playing VGA trek with my younger brother, commanding him to fire photon torpedos and charging into black holes.
</p>
<p>
At some point I discovered this great thing called GW-BASIC and it was all downhill from there. QBasic was my next stepping point, which I used to create a few mouse driven graphical games in DOS. One of my favorites was called UFP - &quot;Unidentified Flying Pizzas&quot;, where you had to click on pizzas and other objects as they scrolled across the screen to shoot them. I wish I still had the source code, that game was awesome.
</p>
<p>
In high school, I started diving into C and C++. I also had a TI-82 calculator, and TI games were all the rage at the time. I created a game or two that actually got pretty popular around my highschool. One was called &quot;TIE Fighter&quot; I think - based on a similar MS-DOS game I had played. You had a target that you moved around the screen, and you would shoot lasers as TIE fighters flew around blasting your base. In retrospect I probably should have been studying harder rather than making games for TI calculators. :-)
</p>
<p>
At this point I had a really good idea what I wanted to do. I loved programming, so I decided to seek a degree in C.S. I ended up going to UCLA, where I graduated in 2005 with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I spent a good deal of my time at university programming in C on Circle MUDs. At the same time, I somehow managed to meet my amazing wife and fooled her into marrying me.
</p>
<p>
When I graduated, I ended up getting a great position at Motorola - right as the RAZR was coming out. I've been living in Illinois ever since with my wife. And I'm still hacking away on my own pet projects.
</p>

<h2>Meeting Lizzie</h2>
<p>
When I was writing this page, before this section, I showed Lizzie a draft and she told me sarcastically &quot;I see how much you wrote about your wife&quot;. I was just saving the best for last, duh. :-)
</p>
<p>
One of the greatest experiences of my life has been meeting my wife, falling in love, and getting married. Yes it is as cheesy as it sounds. Really, I'm just a lucky son of a submariner. Marriage is great, I highly recommend it.
