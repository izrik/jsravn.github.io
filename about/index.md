I'm a professional software engineer with 2 wonderful kids, a
[fluffy dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi), and
[amazing wife](http://www.livingprettyblog.com). I'm an American expat
residing in the sunny part of England, in West London. I wrote a bit
more about my earlier years [here]({% post_url 2013-06-16-growing-up %}).
